# titanic
This repository represents my effort to predict survival in the Kaggle Titanic competition.

The environment.yml file provides the kernel definition used to produce my results.

The titanic.ipynb Jupyter notebook provides all of the analysis for this project.  To re-run this analysis you will need to modify the `data_path` variable in the first code cell to match the directory where you have saved this repository.

The project has been summarized on my Githib page here: [https://buckeye17.github.io/Titanic/](https://buckeye17.github.io/Titanic/)
